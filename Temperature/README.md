# Task scheduler and ADC temperature 

 A timer based task scheduler used for scheduling the tasks of reading the ADC to produce a temperature measurement which is output over UART/Serial. The LED will change color at certain tresholds as well as increase blinking frequency with frequency.

## Includes Code Composer Studio project files

### To run:
- Power up as is and watch the LED's colour and blinking frequency indicate temperature
- Connect your computer to the serial port to see the output in actual degrees
